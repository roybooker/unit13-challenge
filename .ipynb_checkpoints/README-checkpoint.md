# unit13-challenge


### I was hired as a digital transformation consultant by one of the most prominent retirement plan providers in the country; they want to increase their client portfolio, especially by engaging young people. Since machine learning and NLP are disrupting finance to improve customer experience, you decide to create a robo advisor that could be used by customers or potential new customers to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.

### I have combined your new Amazon Web Services skills with your already mastered Python superpowers, to create a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan. ###

--------

## Technologies

This project leverages the AWS lex platform and includes a lambda function. 

## Installation Guide

This bot was created in AWS lex and modified using a lamda function also on the AWS platform


## Observations

The bot was built on the Amazon lex version 1 platform with an add-on lambda function which was run through four stages of testing, correct dialog, age error, incorrect amount error and negative age error. The lambda function testing highlighted that our code could pick up the types of errors we want and adress them correctly to the user.




### Conclusions ###
The lex bot performed its task correctly and could be deployed to be used on the website/mobile app.
